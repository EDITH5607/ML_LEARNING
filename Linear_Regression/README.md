# Linear Regression Models  

This project contains various implementations of **Linear Regression** models. 
Currently, it includes **Simple Linear Regression**, and more models will be added in the future. 

## ðŸ“Œ Current Implementations  
### âœ… 1. Simple Linear Regression - Weight vs Height  
- **Algorithm**: Simple Linear Regression 
- **Independent Variable (X)**: Weight 
- **Dependent Variable (Y)**: Height 
- **Objective**: Train a linear regression model to understand the relationship between weight and height. 
- **Expected Output**: A linear equation of the form.
- ** Height = m * Weight + b**
along with a **scatter plot** showing the regression line.
